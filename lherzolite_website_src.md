# About

The International Orogenic Lherzolite Conference aims to unite specialists in mantle processes to key orogenic mantle peridotite (and related rocks) outcrops worldwide. The conference provides a platform to exchange knowledge and engage in discussions regarding the latest advancements in the processes occurring in the upper mantle and at the transition between the upper mantle and the lower crust. Contributions typically cover a wide range of topics, including melting processes, crustal recycling, significance of mafic lithologies, metasomatism, lithosphere evolution through rejuvenation and refertilization, supra-subduction fluid/melt/deformation processes, feedbacks between deformation and melt segregation/migration, field and experimental studies on mantle/lower crust rocks deformation, geophysical imaging of the Moho transition, mantle structures and flow, or mineral resources related to mantle rocks.

## History

The first International Orogenic Lherzolite meeting was held in Montpellier (France) in 1990 around the Lherz peridotite outcrop in the French Pyrenees. Since then, a total of six Orogenic Lherzolite conferences have been held around the world:

1. 1990 - Montpellier (France) - Lherz peridotite in the French Pyrenees.
2. 1995 - Granada (Spain) - Ronda (Betic Codillera, Spain) and Beni Bousera (Rif Mountains, Morocco) orogenic peridotites.
3. 1999 - Pavia (Italy) - Ivrea, Malenco, Lanzo, Erro-Tobio peridotite outcrops
4. 2002 - Samani (Japan) - Horoman Peridotite Complex in Hokkaido, deep-seated plutonic and metamorphic rocks of the Hidaka Metamorphic Belt, Hayachine and Miyamori ultramafic complexes (Kitakami mountains, NE Honshu island), and deep-seated xenoliths from the Southwest Japan Arc
5. 2008 - Shasta City, California (USA) - Josephine and Trinity (western USA) peridotites.
6. 2014 - Marrakech (Morocco) - Beni Bousera peridotite and Middle and Anti-Atlas mantle xenoliths and ophiolites.

# Practical information

In a nutshell, the 7th Orogenic Lherzolite program is as follows:

## Pre-Conference Excursion

This is a two-day excursion that will take place in the [Cabo Ortegal UNESCO Global Geopark](https://www.unesco.org/en/iggp/geoparks/cabo-ortegal), situated in the region of Galicia in north-western Spain, from September 30th to October 1st, 2024. 

### Transportation

On the afternoon of the 29th of September, one or two buses will transport participants from Oviedo to hotels near the Cabo Ortegal Geopark. The bus will leave Oviedo at 4pm (16h). The meeting point from where the bus will depart is in Trece Rosas Street (co-ordinates: 43.359049, -5.855337; https://maps.app.goo.gl/yBfqoNhCEce42nfX8), in front of the Faculty of Geology. <mark>Please arrive at the meeting point at least 20 minutes in advance.</mark> The trip will take about 3 hours.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> For those arriving in Oviedo on the 29th via Asturias airport, and considering the departure time, the only possible flights are as follows:
>
> \- from Madrid, arrival at 8.45
> \- from Barcelona, arrivals at 9.05 and 13.10
> \- from Alicante, arrival at 15.25
> \- from London, arrival at 14.40
>
> 👉 It is possible to make a stop at Asturias airport to pick up passengers who do not wish to travel from the airport to Oviedo. The pick-up time at the airport would be between 16.40 and 16.50. <mark>It is necessary to inform the organisation before 15 September that you wish to be picked up at Asturias airport</mark>. If there are no requests for this service, there will be no stop at the airport.
>
> If you decide to go directly to A Coruña airport, the closest to the excursion area, without taking the bus from Oviedo, you will need to get from A Coruña to Ferrol yourself. The best option is by bus, https://www.omio.com/buses/a-coruna/ferrol-l3nqs, which is cheap (2-5 €) and there are many daily connections. <mark>If you choose this option, please inform the organisation in advance</mark>.

### Excursion Itinerary

- **Day 1 (September 30th):** The first day will focus on the mantle section, including amphibole-bearing spinel harzburgites, garnet-bearing pyroxenites, chromitites and more.
- **Day 2 (October 1st):** The second day will cover other high pressure high temperature units, including ultramafic cumulates (pyrigarnites), Opx-free garnet granulites, and eclogites. We will have lunch in the field and return to Oviedo in the afternoon.

## Tourism in Oviedo

[Oviedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oviedo) is a vibrant city in the region of Asturias, Spain. Nestled in the north-western part of the country and being the capital city of Asturias, Oviedo offers a rich blend of history, culture and modern amenities. The city is located in the Cantabrian Mountains, surrounded by green landscapes. It is a medium-size (220 000 inhabitants) walkable city, allowing visitors to explore its charming streets and discover hidden gems at their leisure. The city centre offers a pedestrian-friendly environment, making it easy to navigate and ensuring that congress attendees can easily access the venue, as well as enjoy the numerous restaurants, cafes, and shops that line the streets.

With a history dating back to Roman times, Oviedo has preserved its architectural heritage while embracing contemporary development. The city has remarkable monuments that reflect its past. It is particularly renowned for its [Asturian pre-Romanesque architecture](https://www.spain.info/en/top/asturias-pre-romanesque/) style, first appeared in the 8th century, which showcases a unique and influential style from the early Middle Ages. The city is home to a number of exceptional pre-Romanesque buildings, including the Santa María del Naranco palace, the San Julián de los Prados and San Miguel de Lillo churches, the _Cámara Santa_ (Holy Chamber) or the Foncalada fountain, all of them recognized as [UNESCO World Heritage sites](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/312/). Also, the Gothic-style Oviedo Cathedral, built between the centuries 13th and 16th, stands as an impressive example of medieval architecture. The cathedral is less than 5 minutes walk from the conference venue. The [Museum of Fine Arts of Asturias](https://www.museobbaa.com/en/museum/) is also close to the congress area, next to the cathedral, and is free of charge. Oviedo's historic old town, known as the _Casco Antiguo_, is a maze of narrow streets and squares, adorned with beautiful buildings and picturesque plazas. Places to visit near the Congress are _Plaza Trascorrales_, _Plaza de la Constitución_, _Plaza del Fontán_ and _Plaza del Paraguas_.

Lastly, the building that houses the geology studies of the University of Oviedo, built in 1965 by the architect Ignacio Álvarez Castelao, is a protected architectural building which is worth a visit. The building structure comprises two distinct yet interconnected buildings —the departmental building and the lecture hall— nestled within a spacious open area that includes a geological garden. A notable feature of this structure is the lecture hall, which expands akin to the spiral of a mollusc shell. The buildings integrate several works of art linked to different disciplines in the field of geology. The departmental building also houses a geology museum, which is free and a mainstay of geoscience outreach in the region.

## Travel advice

### How to get to Oviedo

#### By Plane

[Asturias Airport](https://www.aena.es/en/asturias.html) is located [40 kilometres from Oviedo](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&destination=43.56268519312678,%20-6.033475003792474) and offers direct flights to several European cities and destinations within Spain. Check the routes on the websites of the following operating airlines:

- [Vueling airlines](https://www.vueling.com/en/) (connections to Barcelona, Paris, London, Palma de Mallorca, Amsterdam, etc.)

- [Volotea](https://www.volotea.com/en/) (connections to Barcelona, Lisbon, Malaga, Milan, Seville, etc.)

- [Iberia](https://www.iberia.com/es/?language=en) (connections to Madrid)

- [Ryanair](https://www.ryanair.com/gb/en) (connections to Brussels, London, Düsseldorf, Rome)

- [Air Nostrum](http://www.airnostrum.es/home.asp?idioma=2) (connections to Madrid)

The cheapest way to get to Oviedo from the airport is by bus (9€) with the [ALSA bus company](https://www.alsa.es/). Buses are on the right hand side as you leave the terminal and run approximately every hour from 6am to midnight. The journey takes about 40 minutes. The ALSA bus will drop you off at the Oviedo bus station, close to the city centre, with connections to city buses and taxis. Another option, although much more expensive, is to take a taxi, which costs around 55-70 euros depending on the time of day. The journey takes about 30 minutes and can be somewhat economical if you share the journey with other travellers.

> [!TIP]
> Although the most common way to enter Spain from outside europe is via Madrid or Barcelona and then find a connection to Oviedo, don't forget to check out airports such as Málaga, Palma de Mallorca, Lisbon, etc., as you can sometimes find cheaper connections with Asturias Airport. You can also try other nearby airports such as [Seve Ballesteros-Santander](https://www.aena.es/en/seve-ballesteros-santander.html) (2 to 3 hours by bus from Oviedo).

#### By Train

Oviedo is directly linked to Madrid by the ALVIA high-speed train with various daily connections (journey < 3:30h), more information here: https://www.renfe.com/es/en [Oviedo north train station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bNNZqo8t1XmX1D9f8) is located close to the city centre and there are many city bus connections nearby. There is also a taxi rank outside the station.

#### By Bus/Coach

There are bus lines between major cities in Spain (Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, etc.) and Oviedo. Check routes in https://www.alsa.com/en/web/bus/home

### Weather

Oviedo has a Cfb oceanic climate. Temperatures in October are usually mild, between 10 and 19ºC, and it commonly rains on a third of the days in the month (although in recent years there has been a trend towards sunnier than usual Octobers). Humidity is generally high, between 75 and 80%.

Regarding Cabo Ortegal, temperatures are also mild in autumn (for reference, see the temperature chart below for the city of A Coruña, 60 km from Cabo Ortegal). Due to the peculiar orography of the area, with cliffs of more than 600 metres next to the sea, the weather can be very variable, even on the same day, and fog is not uncommon. Be prepared for changeable weather. The wind can be quite strong at times in the higher parts of the geopark.

![climate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lherzolite2024/lherzolite2024.github.io/main/imgs/climate.png)

## Social activities

**Thursday, 3rd October – Social Events**

We have some exciting activities lined up for the evening!

At **7:00 PM**, join us for a guided tour of Oviedo’s historic center. The tour will begin at the historic building of the University of Oviedo (the Congress venue) and will last about an hour and a half. We’ll explore some of the city's beautiful landmarks and history, finishing just in time for dinner!

At **8:30 PM**, the tour will wrap up at La Gran Taberna restaurant, where we’ll gather for the Gala Dinner.

**Conference Dinner**

The Conference Dinner will be held at [La Gran Taberna](https://lagrantaberna.es/) in Oviedo. We're going to have a lovely time together at an [espicha](https://eatingasturias.com/wiki/Espicha), which is a special kind of dinner party that's really popular in Asturias. It's a stand-up dinner, which is a really fun way to eat for a large group. You can go around with your plates and serve yourself the food on the tables (like a buffet of traditional _tapas_). This ensures that you mingle, circulate and chat with everyone and get to know them better!
